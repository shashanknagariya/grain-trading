## Technical Dependencies
1. Frontend:
   - React Voice Recorder library
   - Material-UI components
   - Axios for API calls
   - React Context for state management

2. Backend:
   - OpenAI API credentials
   - Audio processing libraries
   - Database migrations
   - Error tracking system

3. Infrastructure:
   - Audio file storage
   - OpenAI API access
   - Database capacity
   - Monitoring tools

## Questions for Clarification
1. What is the maximum duration for voice recording?
2. Should we support multiple languages besides Hindi?
3. What are the specific fields required for each bill type?
4. How should we handle partial or unclear voice inputs?
5. What are the validation rules for the intermediate bill data?
6. How long should we retain intermediate bill data?

## Next Steps
1. Get answers to clarification questions
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin with frontend voice recording implementation
4. Start OpenAI API integration in parallel
